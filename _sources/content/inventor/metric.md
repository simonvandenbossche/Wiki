1. Problem
    ![problem](ClearanceHoleProblem.png)
    Fix order of unit of the thread. (I set "ISO" as my new default.)   
2. Navigate to the data file
    Open "C:\Users\Public\Documents\Autodesk\Inventor 2019\Design Data\XLS\en-US\clearance.xls"
3. Make a backup copy of this file
4. Change the order by changing the number in cell "B1". Make sure the numbers begin with 1 and are consecutive and do no repeat.
    In my case I swapped 2 numbers.
